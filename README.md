# Unity.FreeD

Unity FreeD allows you to move a GameObject based on incoming data in the FreeD format. The component listens to port 40000, which can be changed in the code

## Installation

- Copy the .cs files in the Assets folder into your own project or open this project to play around with the setup
- Add the FreeDLink component to your camera or object to make it move based on the incoming data
